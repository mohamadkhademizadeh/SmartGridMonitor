# SmartGridMonitor
Create a folder SmartGridMonitor.

Save each file (index.html, style.css, data.js, app.js) in that folder.

Open index.html in any browser.

It will display a real-time graph and alert you if the load exceeds 100 kW.

Would you like me to help add:

Dark mode?

API integration (e.g., Firebase or a backend)?

Export to PDF or CSV?

Let me know how far you'd like to take it!
